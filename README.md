# Forecasting-Bitcoin-Price
A Time Series Analysis on Bitcoin Opening price and forecasting with ARIMA model.
The data consisting of Bitcoin opening price start from early 2013 to late 2019.
The data showcase the signifcant flactuation in the opening price. A sudden intervention point (a spike) after 2017 makes the data an interesting one to analysze and model. Also, one may locate some seasonality between 2018 and 2019. Here, in this project, I tried to analyze the data and forecast using a well known ARIMA model.
